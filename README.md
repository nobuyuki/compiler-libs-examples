compiler-libs-examples
======================

This is a rewrite of @no_maddo's `compiler-libs-examples` to the
latest OCaml (4.11.1) and its `compiler-libs`.

See [the original
README](https://github.com/nomaddo/compiler-libs-examples/blob/master/README.md)
for the details.

Its `Makefile` was replaced with `dune`. So just type `dune` rather
than `make`.
